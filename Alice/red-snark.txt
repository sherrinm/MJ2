THE LANDING[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Just the place for a Snark!' the Bellma[31mn cried,[0m
As he landed his crew with care;[31m[0m
Supporting each man on the top of the ti[31mde[0m
By a finger entwined in his hair.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Just the place for a Snark! I have said[31m it twice:[0m
That alone should encourage the crew.[31m[0m
Just the place for a Snark! I have said [31mit thrice:[0m
What i tell you three times is true.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The crew was complete: it included a Boo[31mts--[0m
A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--[31m[0m
A Barrister, brought to arrange their di[31msputes--[0m
And a Broker, to value their goods.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
A Billiard-maker, whose skill was immens[31me,[0m
Might perhaps have won more than his sha[31mre--[0m
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expens[31me,[0m
Had the whole of their cash in his care.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
There was also a Beaver, that paced on t[31mhe deck,[0m
Or would sit making lace in the bow:[31m[0m
And had often (the Bellman said) saved t[31mhem from wreck,[0m
Though none of the sailors knew how.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
There was one who was famed for the numb[31mer of things[0m
He forgot when he entered the ship:[31m[0m
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels [31mand rings,[0m
And the clothes he had bought for the tr[31mip.[0m
[31m[0m
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully pa[31mcked,[0m
With his name painted clearly on each:[31m[0m
But, since he omitted to mention the fac[31mt,[0m
They were all left behind on the beach.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The loss of his clothes hardly mattered,[31m because[0m
He had seven coats on when he came,[31m[0m
With three pairs of boots--but the worst[31m of it was,[0m
He had wholly forgotten his name.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He would answer to 'Hi!' or to any loud [31mcry,[0m
Such as 'Fry me!' or 'Fritter my wig!'[31m[0m
To 'What-you-may-call-um!' or 'What-was-[31mhis-name!'[0m
But especially 'Thing-um-a-jig!'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
While, for those who preferred a more fo[31mrcible word,[0m
He had different names from these:[31m[0m
His intimate friends called him 'Candle-[31mends,'[0m
And his enemies 'Toasted-cheese.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'His form in ungainly--his intellect sma[31mll--'[0m
(So the Bellman would often remark)[31m[0m
'But his courage is perfect! And that, a[31mfter all,[0m
Is the thing that one needs with a Snark[31m.'[0m
[31m[0m
He would joke with hyenas, returning the[31mir stare[0m
With an impudent wag of the head:[31m[0m
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, wit[31mh a bear,[0m
'Just to keep up its spirits,' he said.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too [31mlate--[0m
And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--[31m[0m
He could only bake Bridecake--for which,[31m I may state,[0m
No materials were to be had.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The last of the crew needs especial rema[31mrk,[0m
Though he looked an incredible dunce:[31m[0m
He had just one idea--but, that one bein[31mg 'Snark,'[0m
The good Bellman engaged him at once.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declar[31med,[0m
When the ship had been sailing a week,[31m[0m
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman [31mlooked scared,[0m
And was almost too frightened to speak:[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But at length he explained, in a tremulo[31mus tone,[0m
There was only one Beaver on board;[31m[0m
And that was a tame one he had of his ow[31mn,[0m
Whose death would be deeply deplored.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Beaver, who happened to hear the rem[31mark,[0m
Protested, with tears in its eyes,[31m[0m
That not even the rapture of hunting the[31m Snark[0m
Could atone for that dismal surprise![31m[0m
[31m[0m
It strongly advised that the Butcher sho[31muld be[0m
Conveyed in a separate ship:[31m[0m
But the Bellman declared that would neve[31mr agree[0m
With the plans he had made for the trip:[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Navigation was always a difficult art,[31m[0m
Though with only one ship and one bell:[31m[0m
And he feared he must really decline, fo[31mr his part,[0m
Undertaking another as well.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, [31mto procure[0m
A second-hand dagger-proof coat--[31m[0m
So the Baker advised it-- and next, to i[31mnsure[0m
Its life in some Office of note:[31m[0m
[31m[0m
This the Banker suggested, and offered f[31mor hire[0m
(On moderate terms), or for sale,[31m[0m
Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire[31m,[0m
And one Against Damage From Hail.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day[31m,[0m
Whenever the Butcher was by,[31m[0m
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way[31m,[0m
And appeared unaccountably shy.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Fit the Second[31m[0m
THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Bellman himself they all praised to [31mthe skies--[0m
Such a carriage, such ease and such grac[31me![0m
Such solemnity, too! One could see he wa[31ms wise,[0m
The moment one looked in his face![31m[0m
[31m[0m
He had bought a large map representing t[31mhe sea,[0m
Without the least vestige of land:[31m[0m
And the crew were much pleased when they[31m found it to be[0m
A map they could all understand.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'What's the good of Mercator's North Pol[31mes and Equators,[0m
Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?'[31m[0m
So the Bellman would cry: and the crew w[31mould reply[0m
'They are merely conventional signs![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Other maps are such shapes, with their [31mislands and capes![0m
But we've got our brave Captain to thank[31m:[0m
(So the crew would protest) 'that he's b[31mought us the best--[0m
A perfect and absolute blank!'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
This was charming, no doubt; but they sh[31mortly found out[0m
That the Captain they trusted so well[31m[0m
Had only one notion for crossing the oce[31man,[0m
And that was to tingle his bell.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He was thoughtful and grave--but the ord[31mers he gave[0m
Were enough to bewilder a crew.[31m[0m
When he cried 'Steer to starboard, but k[31meep her head larboard!'[0m
What on earth was the helmsman to do?[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rud[31mder sometimes:[0m
A thing, as the Bellman remarked,[31m[0m
That frequently happens in tropical clim[31mes,[0m
When a vessel is, so to speak, 'snarked.[31m'[0m
[31m[0m
But the principal failing occurred in th[31me sailing,[0m
And the Bellman, perplexed and distresse[31md,[0m
Said he had hoped, at least, when the wi[31mnd blew due East,[0m
That the ship would not travel due West![31m[0m
[31m[0m
But the danger was past--they had landed[31m at last,[0m
With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags[31m:[0m
Yet at first sight the crew were not ple[31mased with the view,[0m
Which consisted to chasms and crags.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Bellman perceived that their spirits[31m were low,[0m
And repeated in musical tone[31m[0m
Some jokes he had kept for a season of w[31moe--[0m
But the crew would do nothing but groan.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He served out some grog with a liberal h[31mand,[0m
And bade them sit down on the beach:[31m[0m
And they could not but own that their Ca[31mptain looked grand,[0m
As he stood and delivered his speech.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend m[31me your ears!'[0m
(They were all of them fond of quotation[31ms:[0m
So they drank to his health, and they ga[31mve him three cheers,[0m
While he served out additional rations).[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'We have sailed many months, we have sai[31mled many weeks,[0m
(Four weeks to the month you may mark),[31m[0m
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who [31mspeaks)[0m
Have we caught the least glimpse of a Sn[31mark![0m
[31m[0m
'We have sailed many weeks, we have sail[31med many days,[0m
(Seven days to the week I allow),[31m[0m
But a Snark, on the which we might lovin[31mgly gaze,[0m
We have never beheld till now![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Come, listen, my men, while I tell you [31magain[0m
The five unmistakable marks[31m[0m
By which you may know, wheresoever you g[31mo,[0m
The warranted genuine Snarks.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Let us take them in order. The first is[31m the taste,[0m
Which is meager and hollow, but crisp:[31m[0m
Like a coat that is rather too tight in [31mthe waist,[0m
With a flavor of Will-o-the-wisp.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Its habit of getting up late you'll agr[31mee[0m
That it carries too far, when I say[31m[0m
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'[31mclock tea,[0m
And dines on the following day.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'The third is its slowness in taking a j[31mest.[0m
Should you happen to venture on one,[31m[0m
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply[31m distressed:[0m
And it always looks grave at a pun.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'The fourth is its fondness for bathing-[31mmachines,[0m
Which is constantly carries about,[31m[0m
And believes that they add to the beauty[31m of scenes--[0m
A sentiment open to doubt.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'The fifth is ambition. It next will be [31mright[0m
To describe each particular batch:[31m[0m
Distinguishing those that have feathers,[31m and bite,[0m
And those that have whiskers, and scratc[31mh.[0m
[31m[0m
'For, although common Snarks do no manne[31mr of harm,[0m
Yet, I feel it my duty to say,[31m[0m
Some are Boojums--' The Bellman broke of[31mf in alarm,[0m
For the Baker had fainted away.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Fit the Third[31m[0m
THE BAKER'S TALE[31m[0m
[31m[0m
They roused him with muffins--they rouse[31md him with ice--[0m
They roused him with mustard and cress--[31m[0m
They roused him with jam and judicious a[31mdvice--[0m
They set him conundrums to guess.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
When at length he sat up and was able to[31m speak,[0m
His sad story he offered to tell;[31m[0m
And the Bellman cried 'Silence! Not even[31m a shriek!'[0m
And excitedly tingled his bell.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek,[31m not a scream,[0m
Scarcely even a howl or a groan,[31m[0m
As the man they called 'Ho!' told his st[31mory of woe[0m
In an antediluvian tone.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'My father and mother were honest, thoug[31mh poor--'[0m
'Skip all that!' cried the Bellman in ha[31mste.[0m
'If it once becomes dark, there's no cha[31mnce of a Snark--[0m
We have hardly a minute to waste!'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'I skip forty years,' said the Baker, in[31m tears,[0m
'And proceed without further remark[31m[0m
To the day when you took me aboard of yo[31mur ship[0m
To help you in hunting the Snark.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was [31mnamed)[0m
Remarked, when I bade him farewell--'[31m[0m
'Oh, skip your dear uncle!' the Bellman [31mexclaimed,[0m
As he angrily tingled his bell.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'He remarked to me then,' said that mild[31mest of men,[0m
' 'If your Snark be a Snark, that is rig[31mht:[0m
Fetch it home by all means--you may serv[31me it with greens,[0m
And it's handy for striking a light.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
' 'You may seek it with thimbles--and se[31mek it with care;[0m
You may hunt it with forks and hope;[31m[0m
You may threaten its life with a railway[31m-share;[0m
You may charm it with smiles and soap--'[31m '[0m
[31m[0m
('That's exactly the method,' the Bellma[31mn bold[0m
In a hasty parenthesis cried,[31m[0m
'That's exactly the way I have always be[31men told[0m
That the capture of Snarks should be tri[31med!')[0m
[31m[0m
' 'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the[31m day,[0m
If your Snark be a Boojum! For then[31m[0m
You will softly and suddenly vanish away[31m,[0m
And never be met with again!'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'It is this, it is this that oppresses m[31my soul,[0m
When I think of my uncle's last words:[31m[0m
And my heart is like nothing so much as [31ma bowl[0m
Brimming over with quivering curds![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'It is this, it is this--' 'We have had [31mthat before!'[0m
The Bellman indignantly said.[31m[0m
And the Baker replied 'Let me say it onc[31me more.[0m
It is this, it is this that I dread![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'I engage with the Snark--every night af[31mter dark--[0m
In a dreamy delirious fight:[31m[0m
I serve it with greens in those shadowy [31mscenes,[0m
And I use it for striking a light:[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that [31mday,[0m
In a moment (of this I am sure),[31m[0m
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away-[31m-[0m
And the notion I cannot endure!'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Fit the fourth[31m[0m
THE HUNTING[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled [31mhis brow.[0m
'If only you'd spoken before![31m[0m
It's excessively awkward to mention it n[31mow,[0m
With the Snark, so to speak, at the door[31m![0m
[31m[0m
'We should all of us grieve, as you well[31m may believe,[0m
If you never were met with again--[31m[0m
But surely, my man, when the voyage bega[31mn,[0m
You might have suggested it then?[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'It's excessively awkward to mention it [31mnow--[0m
As I think I've already remarked.'[31m[0m
And the man they called 'Hi!' replied, w[31mith a sigh,[0m
'I informed you the day we embarked.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'You may charge me with murder--or want [31mof sense--[0m
(We are all of us weak at times):[31m[0m
But the slightest approach to a false pr[31metense[0m
Was never among my crimes![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch[31m--[0m
I said it in German and Greek:[31m[0m
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me muc[31mh)[0m
That English is what you speak!'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
''Tis a pitiful tale,' said the Bellman,[31m whose face[0m
Had grown longer at every word:[31m[0m
'But, now that you've stated the whole o[31mf your case,[0m
More debate would be simply absurd.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'The rest of my speech' (he explained to[31m his men)[0m
'You shall hear when I've leisure to spe[31mak it.[0m
But the Snark is at hand, let me tell yo[31mu again![0m
'Tis your glorious duty to seek it![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'To seek it with thimbles, to seek it wi[31mth care;[0m
To pursue it with forks and hope;[31m[0m
To threaten its life with a railway-shar[31me;[0m
To charm it with smiles and soap![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'For the Snark's a peculiar creature, th[31mat won't[0m
Be caught in a commonplace way.[31m[0m
Do all that you know, and try all that y[31mou don't:[0m
Not a chance must be wasted to-day![31m[0m
[31m[0m
'For England expects--I forbear to proce[31med:[0m
'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:[31m[0m
And you'd best be unpacking the things t[31mhat you need[0m
To rig yourselves out for the fight.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Then the Banker endorsed a blank check ([31mwhich he crossed),[0m
And changed his loose silver for notes.[31m[0m
The Baker with care combed his whiskers [31mand hair,[0m
And shook the dust out of his coats.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Boots and the Broker were sharpening[31m a spade--[0m
Each working the grindstone in turn:[31m[0m
But the Beaver went on making lace, and [31mdisplayed[0m
No interest in the concern:[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Though the Barrister tried to appeal to [31mits pride,[0m
And vainly proceeded to cite[31m[0m
A number of cases, in which making laces[31m[0m
Had been proved an infringement of right[31m.[0m
[31m[0m
The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned[31m[0m
A novel arrangement of bows:[31m[0m
While the Billiard-marker with quivering[31m hand[0m
Was chalking the tip of his nose.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But the Butcher turned nervous, and dres[31msed himself fine,[0m
With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--[31m[0m
Said he felt it exactly like going to di[31mne,[0m
Which the Bellman declared was all 'stuf[31mf.'[0m
[31m[0m
'Introduce me, now there's a good fellow[31m,' he said,[0m
'If we happen to meet it together!'[31m[0m
And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his[31m head,[0m
Said 'That must depend on the weather.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Beaver went simply galumphing about,[31m[0m
At seeing the Butcher so shy:[31m[0m
And even the Baker, though stupid and st[31mout,[0m
Made an effort to wink with one eye.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Be a man!' said the Bellman in wrath, a[31ms he heard[0m
The Butcher beginning to sob.[31m[0m
'Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desp[31merate bird,[0m
We shall need all our strength for the j[31mob!'[0m
[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Fit the Fifth[31m[0m
THE BEAVER'S LESSON[31m[0m
[31m[0m
They sought it with thimbles, they sough[31mt it with care;[0m
They pursued it with forks and hope;[31m[0m
They threatened its life with a railway-[31mshare;[0m
They charmed it with smiles and soap.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious [31mplan[0m
For making a separate sally;[31m[0m
And fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,[31m[0m
A dismal and desolate valley.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But the very same plan to the Beaver occ[31murred:[0m
It had chosen the very same place:[31m[0m
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a wor[31md,[0m
The disgust that appeared in his face.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Each thought he was thinking of nothing [31mbut 'Snark'[0m
And the glorious work of the day;[31m[0m
And each tried to pretend that he did no[31mt remark[0m
That the other was going that way.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But the valley grew narrow and narrower [31mstill,[0m
And the evening got darker and colder,[31m[0m
Till (merely from nervousness, not from [31mgoodwill)[0m
They marched along shoulder to shoulder.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the[31m shuddering sky,[0m
And they knew that some danger was near:[31m[0m
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its[31m tail,[0m
And even the Butcher felt queer.[31m[0m

He thought of his childhood, left far fa[31mr behind--[0m
That blissful and innocent state--[31m[0m
The sound so exactly recalled to his min[31md[0m
A pencil that squeaks on a slate![31m[0m
[31m[0m
''Tis the voice of the Jubjub!' he sudde[31mnly cried.[0m
(This man, that they used to call 'Dunce[31m.')[0m
'As the Bellman would tell you,' he adde[31md with pride,[0m
'I have uttered that sentiment once.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
''Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count[31m, I entreat;[0m
You will find I have told it you twice.[31m[0m
'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof i[31ms complete,[0m
If only I've stated it thrice.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous c[31mare,[0m
Attending to every word:[31m[0m
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe i[31mn despair,[0m
When the third repetition occurred.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
It felt that, in spite of all possible p[31mains,[0m
It had somehow contrived to lose count,[31m[0m
And the only thing now was to rack its p[31moor brains[0m
By reckoning up the amount.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Two added to one--if that could but be [31mdone,'[0m
It said, 'with one's fingers and thumbs![31m'[0m
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier [31myears,[0m
It had taken no pains with its sums.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'The thing can be done,' said the Butche[31mr, 'I think.[0m
The thing must be done, I am sure.[31m[0m
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper [31mand ink,[0m
The best there is time to procure.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens[31m,[0m
And ink in unfailing supplies:[31m[0m
While strange creepy creatures came out [31mof their dens,[0m
And watched them with wondering eyes.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded [31mthem not,[0m
As he wrote with a pen in each hand,[31m[0m
And explained all the while in a popular[31m style[0m
Which the Beaver could well understand.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Taking Three as the subject to reason a[31mbout--[0m
A convenient number to state--[31m[0m

By One Thousand diminished by Eight.[31m[0m

By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:[31m[0m

Exactly and perfectly true.[31m[0m

But much yet remains to be said.[31m[0m
[31m[0m

[31m[0m
In his genial way he proceeded to say[31m[0m
(Forgetting all laws of propriety,[31m[0m

Would have caused quite a thrill in Soci[31mety),[0m

It is ages ahead of the fashion:[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'But it knows any friend it has met once[31m before:[0m
It never will look at a bride:[31m[0m

[31m[0m
'You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in [31mglue:[0m
You condense it with locusts and tape:[31m[0m
Still keeping one principal object in vi[31mew--[0m
To preserve its symmetrical shape.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Butcher would gladly have talked til[31ml next day,[0m
But he felt that the lesson must end,[31m[0m
And he wept with delight in attempting t[31mo say[0m
He considered the Beaver his friend.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
While the Beaver confessed, with affecti[31monate looks[0m
More eloquent even than tears,[31m[0m
It had learned in ten minutes far more t[31mhan all books[0m
Would have taught it in seventy years.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bell[31mman, unmanned[0m
(For a moment) with noble emotion,[31m[0m
Said 'This amply repays all the wearisom[31me days[0m

And when quarrels arose--as one frequent[31mly finds[0m
Quarrels will, spite of every endeavor--[31m[0m
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their[31m minds,[0m

THE BARRISTER'S DREAM[31m[0m
[31m[0m
They sought it with thimbles, they sough[31mt it with care;[0m
They pursued it with forks and hope;[31m[0m
They threatened its life with a railway-[31mshare;[0m
They charmed it with smiles and soap.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But the Barrister, weary of proving in v[31main[0m
That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,[31m[0m
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creat[31mure quite plain[0m
That his fancy had dwelt on so long.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Co[31murt,[0m
Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye[31m,[0m
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was def[31mending a pig[0m
On the charge of deserting its sty.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Witnesses proved, without error or f[31mlaw,[0m
That the sty was deserted when found:[31m[0m
And the Judge kept explaining the state [31mof the law[0m
In a soft under-current of sound.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The indictment had never been clearly ex[31mpressed,[0m
And it seemed that the Snark had begun,[31m[0m
And had spoken three hours, before any o[31mne guessed[0m
What the pig was supposed to have done.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Jury had each formed a different vie[31mw[0m
(Long before the indictment was read),[31m[0m
And they all spoke at once, so that none[31m of them knew[0m
One word that the others had said.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'You must know ---' said the Judge: but [31mthe Snark exclaimed 'Fudge!'[0m
That statute is obsolete quite![31m[0m
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole q[31muestion depends[0m
On an ancient manorial right.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'In the matter of Treason the pig would [31mappear[0m
To have aided, but scarcely abetted:[31m[0m
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it[31m is clear,[0m
If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'The fact of Desertion I will not disput[31me;[0m
But its guilt, as I trust, is removed[31m[0m
(So far as related to the costs of this [31msuit)[0m
By the Alibi which has been proved.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'My poor client's fate now depends on yo[31mu votes.'[0m
Here the speaker sat down in his place,[31m[0m
And directed the Judge to refer to his n[31motes[0m
And briefly to sum up the case.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But the Judge said he never had summed u[31mp before;[0m
So the Snark undertook it instead,[31m[0m
And summed it so well that it came to fa[31mr more[0m
Than the Witnesses ever had said![31m[0m
[31m[0m
When the verdict was called for, the Jur[31my declined,[0m
As the word was so puzzling to spell;[31m[0m
But they ventured to hope that the Snark[31m wouldn't mind[0m
Undertaking that duty as well.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
So the Snark found the verdict, although[31m, as it owned,[0m
It was spent with the toils of the day:[31m[0m
When it said the word 'GUILTY!' the Jury[31m all groaned,[0m
And some of them fainted away.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the [31mJudge being quite[0m
Too nervous to utter a word:[31m[0m
When it rose to its feet, there was sile[31mnce like night,[0m
And the fall of a pin might be heard.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Transportation for lift' was the senten[31mce it gave,[0m
'And *then* to be fined forty pound.'[31m[0m
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge s[31maid he feared[0m
That the phrase was not legally sound.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But their wild exultation was suddenly c[31mhecked[0m
When the jailer informed them, with tear[31ms,[0m
Such a sentence would have not the sligh[31mtest effect,[0m
As the pig had been dead for some years.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply[31m disgusted:[0m
But the Snark, though a little aghast,[31m[0m
As the lawyer to whom the defense was en[31mtrusted,[0m
Went bellowing on to the last.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the be[31mllowing seemed[0m
To grow every moment more clear:[31m[0m
Till he woke to the knell of a furious b[31mell,[0m
Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.[31m[0m

They threatened its life with a railway-[31mshare;[0m
They charmed it with smiles and soap.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
And the Banker, inspired with a courage [31mso new[0m
It was matter for general remark,[31m[0m
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their[31m view[0m
In his zeal to discover the Snark[31m[0m
[31m[0m
But while he was seeking with thimbles a[31mnd care,[0m
A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh[31m[0m
And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked [31min despair,[0m
For he knew it was useless to fly.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He offered large discount--he offered a [31mcheck[0m
(Drawn 'to bearer') for seven-pounds-ten[31m:[0m
But the Bandersnatch merely extended its[31m neck[0m
And grabbed at the Banker again.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Without rest or pause--while those frumi[31mous jaws[0m
Went savagely snapping around-[31m[0m
He skipped and he hopped, and he flounde[31mred and flopped,[0m
Till fainting he fell to the ground.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
The Bandersnatch fled as the others appe[31mared[0m
Led on by that fear-stricken yell:[31m[0m
And the Bellman remarked 'It is just as [31mI feared!'[0m
And solemnly tolled on his bell.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
He was black in the face, and they scarc[31mely could trace[0m
The least likeness to what he had been:[31m[0m
While so great was his fright that his w[31maistcoat turned white-[0m
A wonderful thing to be seen![31m[0m
[31m[0m
To the horror of all who were present th[31mat day.[0m
He uprose in full evening dress,[31m[0m
And with senseless grimaces endeavored t[31mo say[0m
What his tongue could no longer express.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands t[31mhrough his hair--[0m
And chanted in mimsiest tones[31m[0m
Words whose utter inanity proved his ins[31manity,[0m
While he rattled a couple of bones.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
'Leave him here to his fate--it is getti[31mng so late!'[0m
The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.[31m[0m

They shuddered to think that the chase m[31might fail,[0m

Went bounding along on the tip of its ta[31mil,[0m
For the daylight was nearly past.[31m[0m

'There is Thingumbob shouting!' the Bell[31mman said,[0m

They gazed in delight, while the Butcher[31m exclaimed[0m
'He was always a desperate wag!'[31m[0m

On the top of a neighbouring crag.[31m[0m

[31m[0m
'It's a Snark!' was the sound that first[31m came to their ears,[0m
And seemed almost too good to be true.[31m[0m
Then followed a torrent of laughter and [31mcheers:[0m
Then the ominous words 'It's a Boo-'[31m[0m
[31m[0m
Then, silence. Some fancied they heard i[31mn the air[0m
A weary and wandering sigh[31m[0m
Then sounded like '-jum!' but the others[31m declare[0m
It was only a breeze that went by.[31m[0m

Not a button, or feather, or mark,[31m[0m
By which they could tell that they stood[31m on the ground[0m
Where the Baker had met with the Snark.[31m[0m
[31m[0m
In the midst of the word he was trying t[31mo say,[0m
In the midst of his laughter and glee,[31m[0m
He had softly and suddenly vanished away[31m---[0m
For the Snark *was* a Boojum, you see.[31m[0m
