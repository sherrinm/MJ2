He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,
There was only one Beaver on board;
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure

The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
The Beaver brought paper,portfolio, pens,

Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
And the Beaver, excited at last,
